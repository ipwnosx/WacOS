# OpenZFS file system

Development Source: [[GitHub]](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs) [[Other/Unknown]](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs)

OpenZFS is one of the 5 default file systems used in WacOS. If your system is capable, this file system will have more memory capacity than you will ever need, with support for 256 trillion yobibytes (1^128 bytes, or over 340 undecillion bytes, or to be exact, 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,455 bytes) 

The current limitations of this file system are supporting the file system, and the 256 ASCII file path (less when using multibyte characters such as Unicode characters)

It is not compatible with running WacOS on low-end virtual machines or computers with less than 512 gigabytes of memory.
