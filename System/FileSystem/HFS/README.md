# HFS file system

Development Source: [[Unknown]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System)

HFS (Hierarchical File System) is one of the 5 default file systems used in WacOS. If your system is very low end/a virtual machine, this file system will work well on most oldschool virtual machines. It was originally designed for Apple System 2.1 (1985) and isn't fully supported in Mac OS X 10.6 and up, and Windows Vista and up. It is kept for legacy purposes.

## Installation notes

It is recommended to only use this file system if you plan to install WacOS inside a virtual machine, or a computer before 2010.

## Limitations

The current limitations of this file system are the 65,536 file limit (max amount of files on the drive) and the 2 terabyte hard drive capacity. It was originally designed to run on floppy diskettes, and small hard drives from 1985 to ~2005.

Be careful with year bugs, as this file system only supports dates up to February 6th 2040.

This file system is incompatible with MacOS 10.15 and up, and Windows 7 and up.
