# WacOS Default File Systems

## Overview

WacOS by default has 5 options for a file system upon install. The current 5 options are:

1. [HFS](/System/FileSystem/HFS/)

2. [HFS+](/System/FileSystem/HFS+/)

3. [EXT4](/System/FileSystem/EXT4/)

4. [APFS](/System/FileSystem/APFS/)

5. [OpenZFS](/System/FileSystem/OpenZFS/)

## Experimental

Support for HFS, APFS, and OpenZFS is currently experimental. APFS might be the hardest, due to it being so new, and having to be reverse engineered first. HFS might be difficult as well due to how old the format is.

BTRFS is currently under consideration for being a 6th option for a default file system.

## Recommendations

For Apple fans: HFS+, APFS

For less-technical Apple fans: EXT4

For Apple fans with old Apple virtual machines: HFS

For everyone: EXT4

For massive data: OpenZFS
